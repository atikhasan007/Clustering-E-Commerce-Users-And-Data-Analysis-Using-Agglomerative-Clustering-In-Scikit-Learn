E-Commerce Customer Segmentation using Hierarchical Clustering
Problem Statement
To cluster users of an e-commerce platform based on their behavior (e.g., time spent, items added to cart,
purchase history) and identify distinct customer types using Hierarchical Clustering.
Dataset
A realistic dummy dataset was created with 20 samples and 6 features:
- Session_Duration: Duration of the user session (minutes)
- Pages_Visited: Number of pages visited in the session
- Items_in_Cart: Number of items added to the cart
- Avg_Session_Value: Average value of the session (in dollars)
- Time_Spent_on_Site: Time spent on the site (seconds)
- Purchase_History: Total number of past purchases
Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scipy
Steps Performed
1. Data Preparation: Created a dummy dataset and converted it to a pandas DataFrame.
2. Standardization: Used StandardScaler to normalize feature values.
3. Determine Optimal Clusters: Used Dendrogram with linkage method='ward'.
4. Apply Agglomerative Clustering: n_clusters=2, metric='euclidean', linkage='ward'.
E-Commerce Customer Segmentation using Hierarchical Clustering
5. Assign Cluster Names: Cluster 0 - 'Premium Customers', Cluster 1 - 'One-Time Browsers'.
6. Visualize the Result: Scatter plot using Session_Duration vs Avg_Session_Value.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can reveal valuable customer patterns in e-commerce
businesses, helping in better targeting and decision-making.
